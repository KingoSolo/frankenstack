# FrankenStack - Final Demo Script
**Duration:** 3 minutes max (2:45 ideal)  
**Goal:** Make judges say "WOW, this is polished AND technically impressive!"

## 🎥 VIDEO STRUCTURE

### Opening (0:00 - 0:15) - THE HOOK
**Screen:** Landing page with FrankenStack title  
**Visuals:** Spooky green glow, lightning effects  

**Script:**
"API integration is a nightmare. Developers waste DAYS writing glue code to connect REST, GraphQL, and other protocols. FrankenStack solves this with AI-powered adapter generation using Kiro."

**Camera:** Face cam in corner OR just screen recording  
**Music:** Dark, electronic background music (low volume)

---

### Problem Demo (0:15 - 0:30) - ESTABLISH PAIN
**Screen:** Quick montage of code snippets (optional) OR just transition

**Script:**
"The old way: You manually write hundreds of lines of transformation logic, test edge cases, handle errors... and do it all over again for every new API integration. It takes 4+ hours per adapter."

**Visuals:** Show complexity (can use BEFORE_AFTER.md stats as overlay)

---

### Solution Overview (0:30 - 0:50) - KIRO POWER
**Screen:** Kiro IDE showing `.kiro/specs/rest-adapter.yaml`

**Script:**
"FrankenStack changes this with Kiro. First, I wrote detailed specifications that teach Kiro how adapters should work. This 200-line spec defines the code structure, error handling patterns, and transformation logic."

**Action:** Scroll through spec file (slowly)  
**Highlight:** Code patterns section

---

### Kiro Vibe Coding (0:50 - 1:10) - THE MAGIC
**Screen:** Kiro chat with your prompt and generated code

**Script:**
"Then I used Kiro's vibe coding. I gave Kiro a natural language description: 'Connect Stripe webhooks to Shopify orders.' In under 60 seconds, Kiro generated 200 lines of production-ready JavaScript—complete with error handling, retry logic, and field mappings."

**Action:** Show the prompt, scroll through generated code  
**Emphasis:** "60 seconds vs 4 hours"

### Architecture Highlight (2:00 - 2:25) - TECHNICAL DEPTH
**Screen:** Architecture diagram OR `.kiro/` folder structure

**Script:**
"Under the hood, FrankenStack uses all four major Kiro features:"

**Visual list (animated):**
- ✅ Specs (405 lines guiding code generation)
- ✅ Vibe Coding (2 adapters, 400 lines generated)
- ✅ Agent Hooks (automates boilerplate creation)
- ✅ Steering Documents (ensures code quality)

"Plus a complete MCP server specification for protocol analysis."

**Show:** `.kiro/` folder structure in IDE
