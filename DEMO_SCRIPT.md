# FrankenStack Demo Video Script
**Duration:** 3 minutes max  
**Goal:** Show Kiro integration + working adapter generation

---

## Opening (0:00 - 0:20)

**Visual:** Show landing page with title

**Narration:**
"Hi, I'm [Your Name] and this is FrankenStack - an AI-powered tool that stitches incompatible API protocols together using Kiro.

The problem: Developers waste hours writing 'glue code' to connect REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and other protocols. FrankenStack solves this by using Kiro to generate adapters automatically."

---

## Kiro Spec Demo (0:20 - 0:50)

**Visual:** Screen recording in Kiro IDE showing `.kiro/specs/rest-adapter.yaml`

**Narration:**
"Here's how we use Kiro. First, I wrote a detailed specification in YAML that defines how REST-to-GraphQL adapters should work. 

This 200-line spec tells Kiro:
- The code structure to follow
- Error handling patterns
- Field mapping logic
- Example use cases

This is one of Kiro's key features - using specs to guide AI code generation."

---

## Vibe Coding Demo (0:50 - 1:20)

**Visual:** Show Kiro chat with your prompt and generated code

**Narration:**
"Next, I used Kiro's vibe coding feature. I gave Kiro a natural language prompt describing a Stripe-to-Shopify integration.

Kiro read my spec and generated a complete, production-ready adapter with:
- Express.js handlers
- Data transformation logic
- GraphQL client
- Comprehensive error handling

All in under 60 seconds. This would have taken me 3-4 hours to write manually."

## Live App Demo (1:20 - 2:30)

**Visual:** Screen recording of your app

**Narration:**
"Now let's see it in action.

[Select protocols]
I select REST and GraphQL - notice the spooky Frankenstein theme with the glowing effects.

[Fill form]
I describe what I want: 'Connect Stripe webhooks to Shopify orders'

[Click generate]
Click generate... and within seconds, Kiro's code appears!

[Show code viewer]
Here's the generated adapter - 200 lines of production-ready JavaScript. I can copy it, download it, or deploy it immediately.

[Scroll through code]
Notice the field mappings, error handling, GraphQL query builder - all generated by Kiro based on my spec.

[Check database]
And it's saved to our PostgreSQL database so I can access it later."

## Architecture Highlight (2:30 - 2:50)

**Visual:** Show architecture diagram (the Mermaid diagram from design.md)

**Narration:**
"Under the hood, FrankenStack uses:
- Next.js frontend with React Flow for visualization
- Express + tRPC backend for type-safe APIs
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- And most importantly: Kiro throughout the stack for specs, code generation, and future hooks and MCP servers

The entire `.kiro` folder is in our repository - judges can verify every line."

---

## Closing (2:50 - 3:00)

**Visual:** Back to landing page, show GitHub repo

**Narration:**
"FrankenStack: AI-powered API stitching with Kiro. Check out the code on GitHub, and thanks for watching!"
